# Little Lemon Capstone Project üçã

Welcome to the **Little Lemon** restaurant app, built as a capstone project for the Meta Mobile Developer curriculum. This app demonstrates modern React Native development with Expo, focusing on clean UI, local data persistence, and a smooth user experience.

---

## üì± App Overview

**Little Lemon** is a Mediterranean restaurant app that allows users to:

- Browse the menu with images and descriptions
- Filter dishes by category and search by name
- View and edit their profile, including avatar and notification preferences
- Experience a responsive, mobile-first design

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Tabbed Navigation:** Uses Expo Router‚Äôs file-based routing to provide a Home (menu) and Profile tab for easy navigation.
- **Safe Area Support:** All screens are wrapped in `SafeAreaView` to ensure content is displayed correctly on all devices, respecting notches and system UI.
- **Modern UI Components:** Built with [Gluestack UI](https://ui.gluestack.io/) for consistent, themeable, and accessible design.
- **Persistent Local Storage:** Menu data is cached locally using SQLite for offline access and fast loading.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their name, email, phone, avatar, and notification settings, with changes saved locally.
- **Debounced Search:** Menu search input is debounced for performance, updating results only after the user stops typing.
- **Category Filtering:** Menu items can be filtered by multiple categories with a horizontal scrollable selector.
- **Discard Changes:** Profile edits can be discarded, instantly reverting to the last saved state.

## üÜö What‚Äôs Different in This Project?

- **Tabs Instead of Stack Navigation:** The app uses a tabbed interface for Home and Profile, making navigation intuitive and modern.
- **SafeAreaView Everywhere:** All main screens use `SafeAreaView` to prevent UI overlap with device notches and system bars.
- **Gluestack UI for Consistency:** Instead of default React Native components, Gluestack UI is used for all layout and form elements, ensuring a cohesive look and feel.
- **Debounced Search & Category Filtering:** Menu search is optimized for performance, and users can filter by multiple categories at once.
- **Profile Discard Functionality:** Users can revert unsaved profile changes with a single tap, improving UX.
- **Local Menu Caching:** Menu data is fetched once and stored locally, so the app works offline and loads instantly on subsequent launches.
